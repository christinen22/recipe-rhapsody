In this project, I set out to create a web application to provide recipe inspiration for users lacking culinary ideas. The journey began with a pre-study phase, focusing on defining goals, identifying the target audience, and creating wireframes using Figma. The project aimed for a clean and attractive design, incorporating neutral colors and simple yet appealing fonts.
